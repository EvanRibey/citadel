# :black_joker: Citadel Solitaire

A different kind of a solitaire where you move cards one at a time from the piles to the foundations. The only catch being that you cannot move cards in groups, it is only one at a time. Built in a drag and drop manner using SolidJS and TypeScript.

## Features
- Drag and drop movement of cards to/from card piles
- Double click to move eligible cards in their card piles to the foundations

## Personal Notes
I learned about this kind of solitaire during the holidays when I was looking for a more challenging solitaire, one that would require me to think and strategize a bit more. Through some searching, this, and Beleagured Castle came up. I loved the challenge of thinking through turns further in advance, and loved it so much that I wanted to see if I could program it.

The project came up at a convenient time as I wanted to see if I could work with drag and drop more, especially after getting a taste of it in a previous work-related project. This seemed like an easy middle ground to work with, while adding in some additional rules for the drag and drop.

I'm very happy with how the MVP turned out, and no doubt something I will be enjoying when I want a moment to think through a deeper solitaire game without dealing the cards.
